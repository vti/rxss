Find XSS on *your* websites.

The idea is simple: find forms on a page, try different xss patterns on every
field and check that after form submission the pattern is still there.

Usage:

    $ bin/rxss localhost:5000

Provide your own patterns (take a look at patterns/simple.txt):

    $ bin/rxss -p mypatterns.txt localhost:5000
